                Hey friends, as a first-semester CS student and cinematic vlogger, I'm
            thrilled to share my first project:
            <a href="https://www.timelapsespot.com">www.timelapsespot.com</a> 📷
          </p>
  
          <p>
                Combining my passions, I've created this platform where photographers and
            creators can discover and add breathtaking Time-lapse locations.
            🌇🌌
          </p>
  
          <p>
                Despite its "toy project" status, I'm incredibly proud of what I've
            achieved in a month, learning the fundamentals of web development and
            creating a functional website ready for your input! 🚀
          </p>
  
          <p>
                I'm well aware that there's so much room for improvement, and I plan
            to keep built this the website with more skills,
            eventually bringing it to production level! I also intend to add forum
            functionality and other features to enrich our growing community of
            Time-lapse enthusiasts. 🌍
